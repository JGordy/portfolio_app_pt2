            <h5 className="date">9/17/17</h5>
            <p>This is the new addition to the family. My wife and I rescued him from a shelter in Alpharetta. Fitz is a four month old hound/pointer mix who loves sticks larger than he is, loves to cuddle on the couch, and take walks with us by the river. He is especially quiet for a hound, which are known for thier howling.</p>

            <h5 className="date">8/27/17</h5>
            <p>Road trips are always great! This one was to north Georgia at Merciers Orchard. After picking our own apples in the orchard we settled  down for a fantastic lunch, and topped it off with a fudge covered granny smith apple. Yum!</p>

            <p>This was a fun night at campus. A movie scene from Ant Man 2 was being filmed on the bottom floor of my school building. Sadly, I didn't see Paul Rudd or Evangeline Lily. :(</p>
